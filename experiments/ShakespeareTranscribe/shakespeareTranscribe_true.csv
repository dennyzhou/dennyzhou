Master keep going on,I will keep following thee,Till my last gasp,With truth and loyalty,From sixteen years,Till now almost fourscore,Here resided I,But now stay here no more,At sixteen years their fortunes do seek,At fourscore though too late a week,Fortune cannot recompense better,Than to die not a debtor
